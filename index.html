    <h1>Thasvarit Kruerklai (Note)</h1>
    <p>I share everything I think is useful on this page.</p>
  </header>
  <h2>Useful Stuff (at least for myself)</h2>    
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Show-Your-Work-Austin-Kleon/dp/076117897X">You want to connect with experts in your field (share your knowledge online, the more you give, the more others will share with you)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ego-Enemy-Ryan-Holiday/dp/1591847818">Someone told you that you are full of ego, and you want to do something with that (never tell your story like you are a hero, most of the time that is useless for the listener)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.naiin.com/product/detail/570748">You're bored of a lot of stupid productivity frameworks and want only one book to summarize everything of this kind (umm that's already straightforward)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Steal-Like-Artist-Things-Creative/dp/0761169253">You have an idol, someone you look up to and want to imitate some cool parts of them (read, watch, do things that person does, first you have to start finding those things)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://m.se-ed.com/Product/Detail/9786165157445">When you want to brainstorm to start a project with your friends, most of the time it ends up with awkward situations (divide the brainstorm phase into two sub-phases, the first one is to focus on quantity, and next to screen some quality ideas)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ployparploen/videos/1259444694961227">You want to know how industrial engineers boost the productivity of factories (this is a playlist by Kruploy, one of the best teachers in my life)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=2043556029426165&set=a.421548824960235">You are skeptical in behavioral science/economics/finance (if you cut everything impractical out, the thing left from those fancy academic ideas is "how to create an incentive/manipulate people without them noticing", only read the fourth point)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Essential-Calculus-Practice-Workbook-Solutions/dp/1941691242">You want to get an A in calculus but don't care if you really get the concepts or not / don't have a strong high school math background (this one is already straightforward)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://creatorsgarten.org/">You are a developer in Bangkok, Thailand, and you want to make friends (go to Creatorsgarten event)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/27989/Hibike_Euphonium">You want to know how serious Asian high school clubs operate (watch Hibike Euphonium, based on my experience with that kind of club that is very accurate)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.naiin.com/product/detail/475562">You think your life has no meaning, and you love reading Japanese novels (short happy life is a lot better than long suffering life, so you might try more to find your own meaning)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/patvatiwuti/posts/10231666780430041">You want to know how to read research papers (never read every page of the paper if you are not 100% sure that it will be useful, most of the time it is useless to do that)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://theoreticalminimum.com/">You haven't learned all of the physics you were supposed to in school (just learn with the Theoretical Minimum series, you will not be as competent as the people who graduate with their undergrad in physics, but you will know more than average people for sure)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.nakka-rocketry.net/">You want to get started with aerospace engineering by yourself, but not sure how (this blog contains a lot of useful information that even some technology institutes reference a lot of know-how from this blog)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.apogeerockets.com/PeakOfFlight/Archive">You enjoy Richard Nakka's blog but are looking for more practical tips on rocket building (for example, when attaching fins to a rocket, you might want to use alcohol)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Stoicism-Resilience-Confidence-ebook/dp/B07MY2VFQD">You have some kind of mental breakdown from some unacceptable event (just don't give a f*** and only control what can be controlled, it's easy to say but hard to do, so you have to do a lot of exercises at the end of the book)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/quantcornerthailand/">You are interested in quantitative finance and want to know how to get started, and you also live in Thailand (join QuantCorner event or Quant CU if you are studying at Chulalongkorn University, people at the event might be able to give you some ideas to get started)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671027034">You want to be more friendly, but you are an introvert (just create a chance to listen more and speak less)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.statlearning.com/">You want to get an idea of what data science really is (you will start with the most basic concept, linear regression)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2x7cxSGZMc">You want to get started on how to create a very basic economic model (use your intuition on what variables are related to the dependent variable you're interested in, and put it in the formula)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mom-Test-customers-business-everyone/dp/1492180742">You know that at the core of the design thinking framework is to have a lot of talk with the customer, but you are not proficient in interviewing people yet (many wrong questions can provide you with wrong insights, causing you to lose time and money, and that is preventable if we practice how to interview in the first place)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/lexfridman">You're looking for something to listen to at the gym or while running (the Lex Fridman podcast is a great choice. It offers insights into what top experts across various fields are doing)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://sci-hub.se/">You want to get access to paid research papers (paste the DOI from the paper into Sci-Hub)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://libgen.is/">You want a paid book without paying money (use LibGen)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://annas-archive.org/">You tried LibGen and didn't find the book (use Anna's Archive instead)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Lie-Statistics-Darrell-Huff/dp/0393310728">You want to be a passionate statistics student (read how statistics is being used to lie professionally)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Honest-Truth-About-Dishonesty-Everyone-Especially/dp/0062183613">You want to read a behavioral economics book which is purely based on research papers with academic fraud (psychology of lying is interesting, especially in a book that is based on papers created by lying)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYL5ZkxmHWs">You want to build your first personal website, and you don't have bias against using WordPress (this tutorial is great, but if you are not a writer type of person, this won't be worth it)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrZ2zKOtC_-C4rWfapgngoe9o2-ng8ZBr">You want to do some engineering projects, so you want to get started with 3D modeling stuff (my mechanical engineer friend recommended me this)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://resources.krissada.com/">You want to become a web developer (here is a pool of resources by my web dev friend)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@QuantaScienceChannel">You want to know what is at the frontier of STEM stuff (an intelligent physics lecturer I know recommended us this channel)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-ZH3psUbfU">You want to know why I created this page (I listened to this interview and was impressed by the advice of "you should try to be useful")</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRL_NcnK-4">You want to know the basics of how to code but currently have no clear project in mind (Python is a great start; it is something like a generalist languageâ€”it can do many tasks, just not the best at any one thing)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/teepanis.chachiyo/posts/1800152153385657">You want to start reading textbooks (don't read it like a novel)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9430yelFpE">You want to see some practical DATA-DRIVEN COMPANY (by After Yum)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=2035592123471791&id=100010630683080">You want some wedding invitation card inspiration (hope you are an academic)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://sive.rs/">You want to know what someone will do if he already gets enough money to live his whole life and wants to live his life to be as happy as possible (Sivers writing is sharp)</a></li>
