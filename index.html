    <h2>Biography</h2>    
    <p>I'm a sophomore studying metallurgical and materials engineering at Chulalongkorn University. Since high school, I've worked on many side projects. Most didn't contribute much to others—they were just for fun and to do cool things.
    <p>I’ve often been a top student, getting high grades from primary school to grade 10. But when COVID hit, I joined my school’s aerospace engineering club. I struggled with practical projects and realized that doing well in school doesn’t always mean you’re good at hands-on work. That was a tough lesson, so I start practicing Stoic philosophy, especially focusing on controlling what I can and letting go of what I can’t. </p>
    <p>In high school, I read many books that sparked my interest in data science. Later, I realized that mathematics is its backbone. Now, I'm the president of the quantitative finance club at my university, where we organize sessions, work on projects, and connect with Thai quantitative experts. I also help with Google Sheets tasks for TED Club, a volunteer group in Thailand, and do some mathematical modeling for small satellites (though my contribution was minimal). I sometimes contribute to Creatorsgarten, a great community where I made many friends by joining their events.</p>
    <p>I'm fortunate to have a caring family. In my free time, I enjoy drawing abstract art and visiting places like Kinokuniya (since I'm a bookworm) and the Bangkok Art and Culture Centre. I love reading pop science, math, and self-help books, watching random anime (I just finished Hibike Euphonium!), and running in a nearby park to clear my mind. I live by the saying, "If you're feeling down, go for a run—you'll feel much better." My favorite foods are KFC WingZ Zabb, my grandma's fried chicken, and chicken yellow curry.</p>
    <p>A lot of my mindset comes from my mom, my dad’s engineering background, and the communities I’m part of, like SPACE AC, Creatorsgarten, QuantCorner, and TED Club. Feel free to reach out if you’d like to chat.
