    <h2>Biography</h2>    
    <p>I'm a sophomore studying Metallurgical and Materials Engineering at Chulalongkorn University. Outside of class, I’m involved in organizing a quantitative finance club and translating a simple mathematical finance book from English to Thai. Lately, I’ve been exploring topics like casino psychology (especially dark patterns), RFID technology, and how many cool things are often connected to pure and applied math. I love going to events on topics that interest me, especially those organized by Creatorsgarten.</p>
    <p>I’ve often been a top student, getting high grades from primary school to grade 10. But when COVID hit, I joined my school’s aerospace engineering club. I struggled with practical projects and realized that doing well in school doesn’t always mean you’re good at hands-on work. That was a tough lesson, so I start practicing Stoic philosophy, especially focusing on controlling what I can and letting go of what I can’t. My <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/touchvaritnote/">Linkedin</a> might make me seem like a workaholic, and I agree with that—for now.</a></p>
    <p>In my free time, I enjoy drawing abstract art, visiting places like Kinokuniya, the Bangkok Art and Culture Centre, and my high school. I love reading pop science or math and self-help books, watching random anime, and running at a nearby park to clear my mind. I live by the saying, "If you're feeling down, go for a run—you'll feel much better." My favorite foods are KFC WingZ Zabb, my grandma’s fried chicken, and chicken yellow curry.</p>
    <p>A lot of my mindset comes from my mom, my dad’s engineering background, and the communities I’m part of, like SPACE AC, Creatorsgarten, QuantCorner, and TED Club. Feel free to reach out if you’d like to chat.
