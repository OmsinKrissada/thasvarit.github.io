    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <h3>A blamer</h3>
    <p>In high school, I used to look down on people and complain a lot but never actually did anything about it. I thought everything around me was subpar and that I was better than my surroundings, but I didn't show it because I felt the environment didn't support it (which was just an excuse).</p>
    <p>Then I met <a href="https://vt.in.th/">a senior</a> who was two years older than me, also in the gifted program. Unlike me, he didn't let the environment hold him back. I looked him up and found out he had published research before even graduating high school, which was amazing to me. His work was pure engineering—mechanical, electrical, programming, data analysis—all coming together. It was like something adults would do. It totally opened my eyes.</p>
    <p>I was confused. How could he do so much in the same environment I thought wasn't conducive? He didn't wait—he just started it himself. How could he work on projects that seemed beyond high school level and make them look so polished? Plus, he also co-founded the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/spaceactech/">Space AC Institute of Technology</a>.</p>
    <p>Getting to know him literally halved my ego and reminded me that if I left my excuses behind, many doors of opportunity would open in front of me.</p>
    <h3>Mental breakdown</h3>
    <p>A few years back, my mental health was really bad—I was crying and doubting myself every day. I tried everything: more sleep, hanging out more, doing fun stuff, but what really turned things around was stumbling upon stoicism.</p>
    <p>Stoicism is straightforward yet super effective. It says a lot of our bad feelings come from trying to control stuff that's just too hard or impossible to control. So, the trick is to focus on what you can control (you decide what that is) and forget about the rest. It's like dealing with gravity—you accept what you can't change and figure out how to handle it.</p>
    <p>It sounds simple, but making it work takes practice. Whenever I hit a mental roadblock these days, I go back to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Stoicism-Resilience-Confidence-ebook/dp/B07MY2VFQD">my favorite stoic book</a> and do a few exercises from it. I treat it like my personal holy bible for coping.</p>
    <h3>I believe in giving</h3>
    <p>Deals work best when both sides feel like they're getting more than they're giving. So, to win in any circumstance, we need to give a lot.</p>
    <p>By giving a lot to others, they will share their knowledge with us too. This back-and-forth can build a community of people who love sharing and learning.</p> 
    <p>It's totally fine to <a href="https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public">share as a beginner</a>; just be honest about your level.</p>
    <p>"Fake it until you make it" means to act like your ideal self at your current level, not pretending to be an expert if you're not.</p>
    <h3>I write a lot</h3> 
    <p>I started writing in grade 7 and enjoyed watching anime, which made me feel lonely due to few friends sharing this interest. To cope, I started a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BONCARTOON">Facebook page</a> to share my thoughts about anime, which eventually led to improved writing skills and sponsorship. However, later on, I decided to focus more on academic pursuits and felt conflicted about writing purely for dopamine spikes.</p>
    <h3>Multidisciplinary is great</h3>
    <p>I believe in using a mix of different fields to tackle tough problems. There's this community called 'Creatorsgarten' that talks a lot about this.</p>
    <p><a href="https://creatorsgarten.org/wiki/DemocratizeCreationForAll">Their manifesto page</a> really inspired me. Every field has its own toolbox and set of tools. So when experts from different fields come together and aren't bothered by each other's ways of solving problems, some really cool things can happen.</p>
    <p>At the end of the day, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohyai6GIRZg&t=16s">knowledge is knowledge, no matter where it comes from</a></p>
    <h3>The passion tradeoff</h3>
    <p>I've seen endless debates on social media about specialists versus generalists. It seems like most people root for the generalists. But after thinking it over and over, I've realized there's no need to label yourself as either.</p>
    <p>The key is to stay curious and keep learning. With that principle alone, we can handle whatever life throws at us.</p>
    <p>But recently, I've learned the hard way that working harder doesn't always solve everything. There's a tradeoff between hard work and happiness. No matter how passionate you are, nobody wants to grind 24/7. Everyone has their own balance between work and happiness.</p>
    <p>So, we have to carefully choose what works best for us. It sounds simple until your personal life starts falling apart, like mine did. That's when I realized I needed to take action—work less—before everything collapsed.</p>
    <h3>Japanese music</h3>   
    <p>Most of the music I listen to is in Japanese because I prefer lyrics that I don't understand, just playing in the background while I focus on tasks. My favorite songs include <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6NrOm2N7VI">"Shirushi"</a> by Yanagi Nagi, which I listened to during a trip to the USA when I felt down and questioned why I'm so incompetent and feel like a loser.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XGTZVcQ3nM">"Adventure Log"</a> by Luna and Yuaru is another favorite. Its meaning is about a grown-up who goes back to pursue her childhood dream. When I listen to this song, I often think of an inspiring guy who tragically passed away in an accident. Even though I didn't know him personally, hearing his story about bringing people together to work on robotics projects was really inspiring. He's the kind of leader I aspire to be.</p>
    <p>I also like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrtt7mgwCTw">"ASGORE"</a> by Toby Fox, even though I've never played Undertale. Watching the other play it left a mark on me, especially the line "you are filled with determination." That line really resonates with the vibe of the song. (Also don't forget <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBn_BHAXF98">"Bergentrückung."</a>) Another song I enjoy is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOkB_-4O420">"Inochi no Tomoshibi"</a> by Konomi Suzuki—it gives me the feeling of striving hard. I love listening to it while I'm trying to reach my goals.</p>
    </header><h3>Family</h3> 
    <p>My religion has been Buddhism since birth. Compared to my friends, I feel closer to it because my grandma (dad's side) really values Buddhism and often takes us to temples on religious days. Grandpa (dad's side) loves eating grilled chicken with sticky rice, and that love has passed down to my dad and me. </p>   
    <p>On my mom's side, grandma is an amazing cook. I love her fried chicken, chicken curry, and red braised chicken dishes. Grandma is a true pacifist. Sadly, grandpa (mom's side) passed away from cancer before I was born. Mom says he was a kind-hearted man.</p>   
    <p>Dad and I don't talk much; we're both introverts. Sometimes, misunderstandings lead to arguments, but I know he cares about me. He's clever, and whenever I ask for help, he gives practical advice.</p>
    <p>Most of my mindset comes from my mom. She's kind, but when angry, she can be really scary. She spends a lot of time with me and my brother, and I appreciate that quality time.</p>
    <p>My brother is also introverted. I used to enjoy playing games with him a lot, and I hope we can play more soon!</p>
    </header><h3>Friends</h3>  
    <p>Most of my friends are from Assumption College, where I studied for 12 years. I also made many friends at <a href="https://creatorsgarten.org/events"/>Creatorsgarten events</a>, including my close university friends. I enjoy making friends this way because we share the same energy level and vibe. </p>
    <p>When facing life problems, I've found that having one-on-one conversations with trusted friends can really help. It can significantly impact making better life decisions.</p>
  </header><h2>What I'm doing now?</h2>
    <p>Updated July 11th, 2024, from my home in Thailand. It's the rainy season. Two days until <a href="https://stupid.hackathon.in.th/8/"/>the eighth stupid hackathon</a>, and four days until the final exam.</p> 
    </header><h3>Some side projects</h3>  
    <p>Just finished the orbit simulation of Earth, the Sun, and CubeSat after trying for 2 weeks! After organizing <a href="https://www.instagram.com/quantcu/"/>Quant CU</a> as a club for 3 months, it will soon officially become a club under the Engineering Student Committee. With Quant CU settling in, I can now return to contributing to the TED Club as a volunteer on the data and assessment team. 
    </header><h3>To become a club president</h3>  
    <p>Currently learning about leadership. (I believe there is a skill set needed to do this well.) I'm joining <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1998588257256276&set=pb.100013153629381.-2207520000"/>community-building session,</a> reading a book like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=1998588257256276&set=a.421548824960235"/>"Tribes,"</a>
    taking online courses like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/design/thinking/page/courses/Practitioner"/>Enterprise Design Thinking</a>, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1985879971860438&set=pb.100013153629381.-2207520000"/>reverse-engineering how great communities around me operate.</a> I'm pretty sure I now have a clear idea of how to contribute to the community; all that's left is to stop thinking and start acting.</p> 
    <p>Still learning and working on a project about sustainability and causality, hoping it will contribute to the Thai financial industry!</p> 
    </header><h3>I watch movies, many movies</h3>   
    <p>I just noticed that I've been working too hard. So, I decided to take some free time for myself—no side projects, no reading, no lectures, nothing—just chilling. I started watching many of Nawapol Thamrongrattanarit's works (a famous Thai screenwriter), and they are all great! My favorite is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Is_Happy,_Mary_Is_Happy">"Mary Is Happy, Mary Is Happy,"</a>  a movie inspired by 410 tweets from his Twitter follower. The movie is so random that I couldn't guess what would happen next, but I loved it in the end!</p>
    </header><h3>Prepare for material engineering major </h3>
    <p>Currently learning from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TaylorSparks"/>Taylor Sparks' lectures</a>  on the foundations of material science and material informatics.</p>
